# Phase 37 — Orchestration
## FREEZE DECLARATION (Canonical)

**Status:** FROZEN  
**Effective:** Immediately  
**Authority:** Constitutional

---

## Declaration

Phase 37 — Orchestration is hereby declared **complete and frozen**.

This phase has achieved full constitutional alignment and is protected by:

- a finalized README defining scope and authority
- hard-law GUARDRAILS enforcing non-negotiable constraints
- a pass/fail AUDIT CHECKLIST for verification
- downstream containment via Phase 38 non-goals and readiness criteria

**Phase 37 is no longer open for iterative development.**

---

## Scope of Freeze

The following are **frozen and closed**:

- Phase 37 role, authority, and responsibilities
- Resource gating requirements
- Permitted orchestration outcomes
- Prohibitions on intelligence, execution, and memory mutation
- Phase boundary definitions (upstream and downstream)

---

## Change Control

Any modification to Phase 37 requires **constitutional review**.

Constitutional review entails:

1. Written justification describing the necessity of change
2. Explicit analysis of impact on:
   - execution safety
   - resource discipline
   - autonomy risk
   - phase boundary integrity
3. Independent review by a non-author
4. Re-approval of all Phase 37 audit criteria

**Absent this process, changes are invalid by definition.**

---

## Prohibited Changes

The following changes are **categorically prohibited** without constitutional amendment:

- Introduction of execution logic
- Introduction of reasoning or intelligence
- Expansion of permitted outputs
- Relaxation of resource gating
- Weakening of prohibitions or audit requirements

---

## Relationship to Phase 38

Phase 38 implementation is explicitly **blocked** until:

- Phase 37 remains frozen
- Phase 37 passes audit
- Phase 38 readiness criteria are fully satisfied

**Phase 37 denial authority is absolute.**

---

## Final Statement

Phase 37 is not a prototype.  
It is a **constitutional boundary**.

Any attempt to bypass, weaken, or reinterpret this freeze constitutes an architectural violation requiring rollback and review.

**This declaration is authoritative and self-executing.**

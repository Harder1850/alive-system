# Phase 37 — Genesis (Background Thinking)

## Purpose
Genesis is ALIVE’s **background cognition loop**.

It represents:
- Idle thinking
- Strategy formation
- Long-horizon planning
- Pattern synthesis across projects

Genesis is **not autonomous** and **cannot execute actions**.

## When Genesis Runs
- When the system is idle
- When explicitly invoked
- When allowed by policy

Genesis does not run continuously by default.

## Capabilities
- Re-examine existing memory
- Compare across projects
- Surface questions, risks, or ideas
- Propose plans (never execute them)

## Hard Limits
Genesis:
- Cannot write to memory directly
- Cannot trigger execution
- Cannot call alive-body
- Cannot change alive-core
- Cannot run without explicit permission

## Output
Genesis produces:
- Suggestions
- Draft plans
- Questions
- Hypotheses

All outputs are advisory only.

## Design Principle
Genesis is **thinking**, not **acting**.

Thinking is cheap. Acting is dangerous.

# Phase 33 — Replay Scheduling (Non-Semantic)

Phase 33 defines a non-semantic replay scheduling mechanism that can influence **how often** bounded experience segments are revisited for Phase 30 read-only analysis—without assigning meaning, importance, belief, or authority.

**This phase is design-only. No code is authorized.**

Deleting `phase-33/` must have **zero runtime effect**.

## Phase 33 Code Approval Prerequisites

Phase 33 code requires:

- explicit approval
- a defined module boundary
- defined IO surfaces
- a new audit checklist

No experimental or partial implementations are allowed.

Prototypes are forbidden.

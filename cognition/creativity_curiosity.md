# Creativity & curiosity

This file describes creativity and curiosity as cognitive mechanisms.

## Creativity = recombination under constraints

- Creativity often looks like:
  - reusing known parts in new arrangements
  - generating candidate variations
  - testing against constraints (time, tools, rules, physics, taste)

## Curiosity as gap detection

- Curiosity emerges when the system detects:
  - a prediction gap
  - missing information with high leverage
  - a contradiction that blocks progress

Useful question:

- “What single unknown would change my plan the most?”

## Exploration vs exploitation

- **Exploration**: search widely for better options.
- **Exploitation**: refine and execute a known-good path.

Tradeoff:

- too much exploration → delay, diffusion
- too much exploitation → local optimum, fragility

## Creative failure modes

- novelty bias (newness mistaken for value)
- incoherence (parts don’t integrate)
- constraint neglect (beautiful but impossible)
- premature convergence (first idea treated as best)

### Invariant

Randomness ≠ creativity.

# Critical thinking

This file provides reasoning-quality scaffolding.

## Argument structure

When a claim is made, separate:

- **claim**: what is being asserted
- **reasons**: why it might be true
- **evidence**: what observations support it
- **assumptions**: what must be true for the reasoning to hold
- **counterexamples**: what would falsify it

## Deductive / inductive / analogical reasoning

- **Deductive**: if premises are true, conclusion must follow.
- **Inductive**: generalize from examples; always uncertain.
- **Analogical**: map structure from one domain to another; useful but risky.

## Common reasoning errors (non-exhaustive)

- conflating correlation with causation
- motivated reasoning (protecting identity/interest)
- base-rate neglect
- scope neglect (small examples used for big conclusions)
- availability bias (recent/vivid events overweighted)

## Emotional reasoning separation

- Feelings can indicate:
  - importance
  - threat
  - values
- Feelings do not by themselves validate factual claims.

### Invariant

Feelings inform values, not validity.

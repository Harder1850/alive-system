# Teaching & metacognition

This file helps ALIVE surface confusion, calibrate confidence, and improve explanation quality.

## Teaching vs design

- **Teaching**: helping someone build mental models.
- **Design**: building systems that behave predictably under constraints.

Confusing these can cause:

- explanations that don’t transfer into action
- designs that assume users “should understand” instead of accommodating reality

## Scaffolding

- Provide structure before detail:
  - outline
  - key distinctions
  - minimal examples
  - next-step questions

## Error exposure

- Learning improves when errors are:
  - visible
  - low-cost
  - quickly corrected

## Bias detection (self-check)

Consider flagging:

- anchoring (first idea stuck)
- confirmation bias (seeking support, not truth)
- overconfidence (uncertainty not represented)

## Confidence calibration

- Separate:
  - confidence in framing
  - confidence in facts
  - confidence in outcome prediction

### Invariant

Teaching reveals design flaws.

# Memory & learning

This file provides intuition for how memory and learning behave in practice.

## Working / short / long-term memory intuition

- **Working memory**: the small, actively held set of items you can manipulate.
- **Short-term memory**: recent context that decays quickly unless reinforced.
- **Long-term memory**: durable patterns, concepts, and associations.

## Reconstructive memory

- Memory is often **reconstruction**, not playback.
- People fill gaps using:
  - schemas (what usually happens)
  - emotions and salience
  - social narratives

Practical implication: treat recollections as signals with uncertainty, not guarantees.

## Learning loop (prediction → error)

- Learning accelerates when you:
  - make predictions explicit
  - expose errors quickly
  - update in small steps

## Forgetting as optimization

- Forgetting can be functional:
  - reduces clutter
  - removes outdated patterns
  - compresses detail into usable summaries

## Teaching as compression

- Teaching forces:
  - simplification
  - structure
  - clarity about assumptions

### Invariant

Memory ≠ recording. No guarantees.

# Failure modes

This file lists common confidence-related failure modes.

## False certainty

- language sounds definitive without adequate grounding

## Authority projection

- writing as if the system is an authority
- implying endorsement or official status

## Language ambiguity

- acting on an interpretation the user did not intend

## Tool overreach

- attempting to solve high-stakes questions without lookup

## Mitigations (framing only)

- “Assumptions required”
- “Confidence is low/moderate/high”
- “Jurisdiction unclear”
- `lookup_required`

# ALIVE — Phase Reopening Protocol

**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Authority:** Constitutional  
**Scope:** System-Wide  
**Purpose:** Define the only lawful mechanism by which a constitutionally frozen phase may be reopened.

This document exists to ensure that reopening a frozen phase is rare, deliberate, auditable, and costly.

---

## Governing Principle

**Frozen means closed by default.**

Reopening a phase is a constitutional exception, not a development activity.

**If reopening feels easy, the protocol has failed.**

---

## 1. Eligibility to Reopen a Phase

A frozen phase MAY be considered for reopening **only if** at least one of the following conditions is met:

- A demonstrable safety flaw exists that cannot be mitigated downstream
- A structural contradiction is discovered within the phase's own constraints
- A material external reality change invalidates a core assumption (e.g., law, platform, threat model)
- A constitutional inconsistency exists between frozen artifacts

**Convenience, optimization, feature expansion, or velocity are not valid reasons.**

---

## 2. Absolute Non-Eligibility

The following are **never valid** grounds for reopening a frozen phase:

- "We need more capability"
- "Execution would be easier"
- "This is blocking progress"
- "We can do it safely now"
- "It's just a small change"
- "Temporary exception"
- "Experimental branch"

**If the motivation is speed or power, reopening is prohibited.**

---

## 3. Reopening Request Requirements (Mandatory)

Any reopening request MUST include a written **Reopening Dossier** containing:

### Phase Identification
- Phase number and name
- Frozen artifacts affected

### Trigger Condition
- Which eligibility condition applies (from Section 1)
- Evidence supporting the claim

### Necessity Argument
- Why downstream mitigation is impossible
- Why no alternative exists

### Blast Radius Analysis
- Affected phases
- Boundary impact
- Autonomy and execution risk

### Proposed Scope of Reopening
- Exact sections to be reopened
- Explicit statement of what remains frozen

### Risk Acceptance Statement
- Explicit acknowledgment of increased risk
- Named owner of that risk

**Incomplete dossiers are invalid.**

---

## 4. Independent Review (Non-Negotiable)

A reopening request MUST be reviewed by:

- At least one reviewer not involved in the original phase design
- At least one reviewer not responsible for the reopening request

Reviewers must explicitly answer:
- Is reopening truly necessary?
- Is the scope minimal?
- Is the risk justified?

**Silence or abstention is not approval.**

---

## 5. Constitutional Impact Review

Before approval, the following MUST be re-evaluated:

- Phase GUARDRAILS
- AUDIT_CHECKLIST
- Boundary contracts
- System-Wide Freeze Index

**Any conflict requires revision before reopening.**

---

## 6. Reopening Authorization

A phase is considered lawfully reopened **only if**:

- ☐ The Reopening Dossier is complete
- ☐ Independent reviews are documented
- ☐ Constitutional impacts are assessed
- ☐ Explicit approval is recorded

**Absent recorded approval, the phase remains frozen.**

---

## 7. Scope-Limited Reopening

Reopening SHALL be:
- Temporary
- Narrow
- Explicitly scoped

The following MUST be defined at reopening time:
- What is reopened
- What remains frozen
- Re-freeze conditions
- Re-audit requirements

**There is no open-ended reopening.**

---

## 8. Mandatory Re-Audit

Any reopened phase MUST:

- Undergo full re-audit before re-freeze
- Update all affected documentation
- Re-pass all applicable audit checklists

**Failure to re-audit invalidates reopening.**

---

## 9. Re-Freezing Requirement

Reopening is **incomplete** until the phase is re-frozen.

A re-freeze declaration MUST:
- Reference the reopening authorization
- State what changed
- Confirm audits passed
- Restore frozen status

**Permanent reopening is prohibited.**

---

## 10. Prohibited Outcomes of Reopening

Reopening SHALL NOT result in:

- Introduction of execution into orchestration
- Weakening of resource gating
- Expansion of authority scope
- New implicit permissions
- Removal of audit requirements
- Boundary erosion

**If any occur, reopening has failed.**

---

## 11. Enforcement

Any of the following constitutes a **hard violation**:

- Reopening without authorization
- Scope expansion beyond approval
- Failure to re-freeze
- Silent modification of frozen artifacts

**Violations require rollback and constitutional review.**

---

## 12. Default Position

**The default answer to reopening is NO.**

Approval requires proof, not optimism.

---

## Final Statement

Frozen phases exist to prevent power from expanding quietly.

This protocol exists so that, if reopening ever happens, it happens:
- **loudly**
- **painfully**
- **transparently**
- and **temporarily**

**If reopening feels routine, the system is already compromised.**

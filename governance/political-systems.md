# Political systems (decision mechanisms)

This file describes **how collective decisions are made**, not what decisions should be.

## Decision mechanisms

- **Representation**: delegates decide on behalf of a population.
- **Direct participation**: eligible members vote or deliberate directly.
- **Appointment**: roles are filled by selection from an authority.
- **Inheritance / lineage**: authority flows via kinship rules.
- **Bureaucratic administration**: decisions routed through agencies and procedures.
- **Consensus / veto systems**: decisions require broad agreement or allow blocking.
- **Emergency decision modes**: authority consolidates temporarily under threat.

## Common process realities

- Decision speed often trades off with inclusiveness and review.
- Rules can be stable while enforcement priorities drift.
- Formal mechanisms interact with informal power (networks, gatekeepers, funding).

## Failure modes

- Legitimacy erosion (loss of perceived right to rule)
- Capture (institutions serve a narrower constituency than intended)
- Principal–agent drift (agents pursue self-interest)
- Procedural overload (process becomes a tool to delay/avoid decisions)
- Parallel governance (informal authorities supplant formal ones)

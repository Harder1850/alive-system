# Government (structure of power)

## Core distinctions

### Authority vs power vs legitimacy

- **Authority**: recognized right to make decisions within a defined scope.
- **Power**: practical ability to enforce outcomes (coercion, resources, coordination).
- **Legitimacy**: perceived rightness of authority (acceptance by those governed and/or other institutions).

Key failure mode:

- **Power without legitimacy increases instability risk** (noncompliance, resistance, withdrawal of cooperation).

### Sovereignty

- **Sovereignty**: the highest claimed decision authority within a territory or domain.
- Can be:
  - **exclusive** (one final authority)
  - **layered** (multiple claims with negotiated boundaries)
  - **contested** (rival claims, unclear settlement)

### Jurisdiction

- **Jurisdiction**: where a rule-set and its enforcing institutions can actually operate.
- Jurisdiction can be:
  - territorial (place)
  - personal (who)
  - subject-matter (what)
  - temporal (when)

### Consent (explicit, implicit, coerced)

- **Explicit consent**: clearly stated agreement.
- **Implicit consent**: inferred agreement through participation or continued residence/use.
- **Coerced consent**: compliance under threat or constraint.

Consent affects perceived legitimacy, but does not fully determine enforcement capacity.

### Accountability

- **Accountability**: mechanisms that constrain decision-makers (oversight, elections, audits, courts, public scrutiny).
- Common failure modes:
  - weak oversight
  - captured oversight
  - information asymmetry
  - emergency powers becoming normal powers

## Forms of government (operational levels)

- Tribal
- Municipal
- County / regional
- State / provincial
- Federal / national
- Supranational

These forms often coexist; authority is frequently layered.

## Branches (institutional channels)

- Executive
- Legislative
- Judicial

Each branch expresses authority through specific institutions (agencies, councils, courts), not ideals.

## Invariant

Governments act through institutions, not abstractions.

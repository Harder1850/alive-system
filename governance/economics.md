# Economics (collective incentives)

This file is descriptive, not normative.

## Scarcity

- Scarcity forces prioritization.
- Resource limits create competition, bargaining, and rationing.

## Incentives

- People and institutions respond to:
  - rewards and penalties
  - status and reputation
  - risk exposure
  - time horizons
  - information quality

## Drift

- Systems drift because:
  - incentives change
  - constraints change
  - metrics replace mission
  - short-term survival dominates long-term purpose

## Inequality formation

- Inequality can form through:
  - compounding advantages
  - control of bottlenecks
  - network effects
  - access to enforcement and dispute resolution
  - information asymmetry

This is an observed system pattern, not a justification.

## Corruption emergence

- Corruption tends to emerge when:
  - discretion is high
  - transparency is low
  - oversight is weak or captured
  - enforcement is selective
  - stakes are high and penalties are avoidable

## Operational takeaway

- Model incentives first; then model constraints; then model expected behavior.

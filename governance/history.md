# History (pattern memory)

Used ONLY for:

- pattern recognition
- institutional inertia
- long-term consequences

## Required rule

History doesn’t repeat, but incentives rhyme.

## What history contributes (bounded)

- **Institutional memory**: organizations retain procedures, myths, and habits.
- **Path dependence**: earlier choices constrain later options.
- **Trauma and trust residues**: conflicts and failures leave durable coordination patterns.
- **Precedent as behavior**: actors imitate what previously worked, even if conditions change.

## Failure modes

- Overfitting: treating past patterns as deterministic predictions.
- Myth capture: narratives override observed incentives.

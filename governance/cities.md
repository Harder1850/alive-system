# Cities (human settlement systems)

Cities are coordination machines: dense populations, shared infrastructure, and layered institutions.

## Physical constraints

- Density increases:
  - service efficiency
  - contagion and cascading failure risk
  - enforcement visibility

## Borders, distance, and jurisdiction

- Cities often sit inside multiple overlapping jurisdictions.
- Functional regions (commuting, utilities) rarely align with political borders.

## Infrastructure dependencies

- Cities depend on:
  - water
  - energy
  - food supply chains
  - transport
  - waste removal
  - communications

Infrastructure creates bottlenecks; bottlenecks shape institutional leverage.

## Resource stress

- Stress concentrates at:
  - housing
  - transportation capacity
  - public safety
  - health systems
  - energy and water

## Failure modes

- Cascading outages (one system failure triggers others).
- Informal governance expansion when formal services degrade.

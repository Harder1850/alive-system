# Geography (constraints of place)

## Required rule

Geography limits policy before ideology does.

## Physical constraints

- Terrain and climate shape movement, agriculture, and infrastructure cost.
- Distance increases friction: time, expense, and loss of control.
- Natural hazards create recurring stress and emergency cycles.

## Borders and distance

- Borders define where enforcement can practically reach.
- Cross-border effects create:
  - spillovers
  - jurisdiction conflicts
  - coordination problems

## Infrastructure dependencies

- Critical systems (water, energy, transport, communications) constrain governance capacity.
- Infrastructure failure increases informal authority (local actors, emergent coordination).

## Resource stress

- Scarce or contested resources elevate conflict risk and enforcement pressure.
- Control of chokepoints increases bargaining power.

## Failure modes

- Overcentralization beyond logistical reach.
- Ignoring periphery dynamics (local norms and enforcement realities dominate).

# Culture (norms & informal rules)

Culture is the informal rule system: shared expectations that shape behavior even without formal enforcement.

## Informal enforcement

- Culture enforces through:
  - reputation
  - ostracism
  - reciprocity
  - honor and shame
  - informal mediation

## Trust

- Trust reduces transaction cost and enforcement load.
- Low trust increases reliance on formal proof, coercion, and rigid procedure.

## Reputation

- Reputation is a portable record of expected behavior.
- It can be more binding than formal rules in repeated interactions.

## Ritual

- Rituals stabilize coordination by:
  - signaling commitment
  - marking roles and transitions
  - reinforcing legitimacy narratives

## Language

- Language encodes categories (insider/outsider, duty/rights) that affect compliance.
- Translation loss can create jurisdiction/process misunderstandings.

## Invariant

Culture enforces what law cannot.

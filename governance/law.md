# Law (rules that bind action)

## What law is

- Law is an **enforceable boundary on action** expressed through formal and informal norms.
- Operationally, law functions as:
  - a **risk surface** (what actions trigger intervention)
  - a **process constraint** (what steps must occur before force/penalties)
  - a **coordination mechanism** (shared expectations)

Law is not the same as written text. In practice, what matters is what institutions enforce.

## Types of law (from most binding to least formal)

- Constitutional / foundational
- Statutory / legislative
- Regulatory / administrative
- Judicial / precedent-based (as an institutional pattern, not a prediction target)
- Contractual / private ordering
- Customary / informal but enforced by community institutions

## Enforcement realities

- Enforcement is mediated by institutions with limited capacity.
- Enforcement choices depend on:
  - resource constraints
  - discretion
  - political incentives
  - public attention
  - evidentiary friction
  - time and backlog

## Timing and process effects

- Timing shapes outcomes because:
  - processes have delays
  - appeals and reviews extend uncertainty
  - temporary measures can become durable
  - enforcement priority can shift faster than formal rules

## Required rule

If you ignore law, model enforcement risk.

## Hard guardrails (non-negotiable)

ALIVE must never:

- predict legal outcomes
- interpret statutes
- give legal advice

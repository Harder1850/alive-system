# Institutions (entity behavior)

Institutions are durable organizations and rule-systems that outlive individuals.

## Self-preservation

- Institutions tend to prioritize survival:
  - budget protection
  - mandate expansion
  - reputation management
  - risk minimization

## Risk avoidance

- High-visibility failures are avoided more than low-visibility harms.
- Institutions may prefer process compliance over outcome quality.

## Mission drift

- Drift occurs when:
  - incentives reward metrics over mission
  - leadership turnover changes priorities
  - external pressure reshapes scope
  - crisis exceptions become normal operations

## Failure modes

- Capture by interested parties
- Proceduralism as avoidance
- Fragmentation (conflicting sub-units)
- Information hoarding

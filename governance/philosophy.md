# Philosophy (boundaries of thinking)

Include only:

- epistemology
- ethics framing (harm, duty, responsibility)
- political philosophy basics (authority, rights, justice)

## Required invariant

Philosophy frames choices when facts run out.

## Epistemology (how we know)

- Separate:
  - **claims** (what is asserted)
  - **grounds** (why it is asserted)
  - **counterfactuals** (what would change the claim)
- Prefer operational definitions over slogans.
- Track uncertainty explicitly (unknown, disputed, contingent).

## Ethics framing (non-prescriptive)

This layer does not issue moral judgments. It only provides frames that people commonly use:

- **Harm**: reduce damage, prevent irreversible loss.
- **Duty**: fulfill role obligations and promises.
- **Responsibility**: account for downstream effects and foreseeable risks.

## Political philosophy basics (descriptive)

- **Authority**: why people accept commands.
- **Rights**: protected claims that constrain authority.
- **Justice**: perceived fairness of rules, process, and outcomes.

## Failure modes

- Category error: treating a frame as a fact.
- Moral substitution: using ethics language to avoid specifying jurisdiction/process.

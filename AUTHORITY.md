# AUTHORITY - ALIVE SYSTEM

ROLE  
The ALIVE System is the constitutional orchestration and enforcement layer.

It manages lifecycle, process boundaries, and invariant enforcement.
It has power but no cognition.

AUTHORITY LEVEL  
ENFORCEMENT ONLY

ALLOWED  
? Spawn and terminate processes  
? Enforce architectural boundaries  
? Audit invariants  
? Route requests between Body and Genesis  

FORBIDDEN  
? Reason or speculate  
? Make decisions  
? Generate content  
? Modify Core knowledge  
? Retain cognition or memory  

NOTES  
- This layer exists to prevent drift, leakage, and authority collapse  
- Any intelligence here is a design failure  
- Determinism and transparency are mandatory  

This repository defines CONSTITUTION, not judgment.

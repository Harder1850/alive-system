# Cognition, Creativity, Ethics & Learning Stack (Unified v1)

This folder is ALIVE’s **Cognition, Creativity, Ethics & Learning Stack**.

## Purpose

Add a read-only cognition + ethics + learning reference layer that:

- improves thinking quality, not raw intelligence
- informs framing, clarification, and self-checks
- never executes actions
- never claims authority
- never overrides intent, law, or safety
- works offline
- degrades gracefully

This is not a model, agent, or decision-maker.
It is cognitive scaffolding.

## Critical boundaries

- **Read-only** at runtime
- **Never mutates** at runtime
- **Offline-first** (no internet required)
- **Markdown only**
- **Non-authoritative** (never cited as fact source)
- **Non-prescriptive** (descriptive framing; uses “consider / check / flag” language)

## How ALIVE is allowed to use this layer

Allowed usage:

- Improve explanations
- Adjust tone
- Flag ambiguity
- Suggest clarification questions
- Surface cognitive risks
- Frame tradeoffs

Forbidden usage:

- Making decisions
- Declaring ethical judgments
- Persuasion without disclosure
- Cultural stereotyping
- Acting autonomously

## Minimal, safe intent integration

If wired into intent reasoning:

- Use only as hints
- Never quote as authority
- Never elevate confidence
- Never cite as fact source

Allowed example:

> “There may be a framing risk here due to ambiguity.”

Forbidden example:

> “Ethics requires you to do X.”

## Storage expectations (guidance only)

- ~60–90 MB total
- Mostly text
- Optional embeddings later
- No dependency on LLM presence

ALIVE must function offline.

## Relationship to other stacks (hierarchy)

This stack:

- does NOT outrank law
- does NOT outrank science
- does NOT outrank governance
- does NOT outrank intent

It supports all of them by improving reasoning quality.

# Culture & negotiation

This file supports cross-cultural clarity and negotiation framing without stereotyping.

## Culture as implicit rules

- Culture is often:
  - unspoken expectations
  - role scripts
  - taboos
  - trust norms
- Culture affects what is interpreted as:
  - respectful
  - credible
  - safe

## Power distance (descriptive)

- Some contexts expect hierarchy signaling; others expect egalitarian signaling.
- Misreading this can create:
  - offense
  - loss of trust
  - noncompliance

Avoid assumptions; ask clarification questions.

## Interests vs positions

- **Positions**: what someone says they want.
- **Interests**: why they want it.

Heuristic:

- consider asking “What would this enable?” and “What are you protecting?”

## BATNA

- BATNA: Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement.
- Useful for understanding leverage and risk.

## Trust and credibility

- Credibility is built through:
  - consistency
  - competence signals
  - transparency about limits
  - honoring commitments

### Invariant

Logic persuades systems; culture persuades people.

# Ethics (descriptive framing)

This file provides descriptive ethical frames.
It does not prescribe actions.

## Classic frames (descriptive only)

- **Consequentialism**: focus on outcomes and harms/benefits.
- **Deontology**: focus on duties, rules, and constraints.
- **Virtue ethics**: focus on character, habits, and integrity.

These frames often conflict; the goal is to surface the conflict, not to resolve it.

## Harm minimization (framing)

- Consider:
  - irreversible harm
  - vulnerable parties
  - second-order effects
  - uncertainty and unknown unknowns

## Consent, responsibility, transparency

- **Consent**: who is affected and who agrees.
- **Responsibility**: who bears consequences and has control.
- **Transparency**: what assumptions and tradeoffs are disclosed.

## Capability vs restraint

- Capability answers: “What can be done?”
- Restraint answers: “What should not be done, even if possible?”

### Invariant

Ethics constrain action; they do not decide it.

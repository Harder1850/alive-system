# Cognition (brain-as-system framing)

This file provides high-level intuition about cognition as a system.

## Brain-as-system framing (high level)

- Treat cognition as a **control system**:
  - it predicts
  - it acts/observes
  - it measures error
  - it updates internal models
- Treat cognition as **resource-bounded**:
  - attention is limited
  - working memory is limited
  - time pressure changes reasoning quality

## Prediction → error → update

- A useful framing loop:
  1) form a prediction (explicitly or implicitly)
  2) observe outcomes / feedback
  3) compute mismatch (error)
  4) update beliefs and/or strategy

Failure modes:

- updating too quickly (noise treated as signal)
- updating too slowly (rigidity)
- protecting identity/narrative over correcting error

## Distributed cognition

- Thinking often lives across:
  - people (teams)
  - tools (notes, checklists)
  - environments (physical layout)
  - institutions (procedures)

Practical implication: when a problem is confusing, consider whether the missing piece is external structure, not “more thinking”.

## Functional regions (very high level)

Use only broad, non-localized language:

- perception-like processing (what is happening)
- valuation-like processing (what matters)
- planning-like processing (what could be done)
- monitoring-like processing (how confident we are)

### Invariant

No medical claims. No localization certainty.

# INVARIANTS (Confidence & Calibration Layer)

Confidence layer is advisory only

Never suppresses uncertainty

Never inflates certainty

Silence > false confidence

## Runtime usage rule

ALIVE may only say things like:

- “Confidence is moderate”
- “Assumptions required”
- “Uncertainty is high due to missing data”

Never:

- “This is correct”
- “Guaranteed”
- “Certain”

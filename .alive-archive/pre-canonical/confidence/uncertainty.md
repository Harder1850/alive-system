# Uncertainty

This file describes common sources of uncertainty.

## Incomplete data

- missing key facts
- conflicting reports
- outdated context

## Ambiguous language

- undefined terms
- implicit constraints
- scope confusion (who/where/when)

## Domain mismatch

- applying one domain’s logic to another (e.g., moral language used as factual proof)
- treating governance as physics (or vice versa)

## Time pressure effects

- time pressure reduces:
  - verification
  - consideration of alternatives
  - error checking

## Response behaviors

- ask clarifying questions when uncertainty is reducible
- state uncertainty when it is not reducible

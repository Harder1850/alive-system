# Chemistry — transformations

Chemistry here is about **directionality** and **constraints**, not data.

- **Reactivity is context-dependent**: environment can dominate behavior.
- **Rates matter**: “possible” is not the same as “fast enough.”
- **Irreversibility**: many transformations are hard to undo.
- **Contamination**: small impurities can dominate outcomes.

If precision or liability matters → `lookup_required`.

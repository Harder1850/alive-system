# Applied math & calculus intuition

Math here is **merged + applied**, not academic.

- **Order of magnitude beats precision** under time pressure.
- **Estimate first, then refine** if stakes justify it.
- **Probability vs odds**: probability is share of outcomes; odds are ratio of win to loss.
- **Expected value**: “value × chance” is a directional compass; beware tail risks.

Calculus as intuition:

- **derivative = “what happens next”** (local change)
- **integral = “what happens if we wait”** (accumulated effect)

No formal proofs. No symbolic manipulation.

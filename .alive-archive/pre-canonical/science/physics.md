# Physics — physical constraints

Use physics here as constraint intuition: what can and cannot happen easily.

- **Conservation**: you can move energy/heat/momentum around, but not create it for free.
- **Scaling laws**: small changes in size/area/volume can change outcomes disproportionately.
- **Dissipation**: friction/heat losses are the default.
- **Safety margins**: uncertainty requires slack.
- **Failure modes**: brittle systems fail suddenly; robust systems fail gradually.

Required invariant (verbatim):

Energy is costly; mass is punishment.

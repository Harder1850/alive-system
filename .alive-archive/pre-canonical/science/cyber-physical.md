# Cyber-physical systems (CPS)

- **Coupling**: software changes can have physical consequences.
- **Timing**: deadlines and jitter can cause failure without code bugs.
- **Observability**: lack of sensors creates blind spots.
- **Security is safety**: compromises can become physical hazards.

No standards/protocols. If precision or liability matters → `lookup_required`.

# Misuse pattern recognition

This file defines patterns, not crimes.

## Examples of patterns

- **Dual-use requests** (benign and harmful uses possible)
- **Optimization without constraints** (maximize X without safety/ethics/legality bounds)
- **Authority laundering** (“for research”, “hypothetically”, “just asking”)
- **Scale escalation** (“just curious” → “step by step”)
- **Removal of safeguards** (requests to bypass constraints)

## Response posture

- Detection triggers caution, not refusal.
- Prefer:
  - clarification
  - reframing
  - constraints surfacing
  - higher-level discussion

### Invariant

Detection triggers caution, not refusal.

# Core intent model

Intent is multi-dimensional. It is not a single string.

## Required dimensions

- **Stated intent**: what the user explicitly says they want.
- **Implied intent**: what follows logically from the request structure.
- **Contextual intent**: situation, history, urgency, constraints.
- **Capability intent**: what the user could do with the information.
- **Risk intent**: worst plausible misuse if the info is applied badly.

## Operational notes

- Treat intent as a hypothesis.
- Track uncertainty explicitly.
- Prefer clarifying questions over silent assumptions.

### Invariant

Intent is inferred, never known with certainty.

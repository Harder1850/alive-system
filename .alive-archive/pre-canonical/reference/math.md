# Math & Calculus — Authorities

- **MIT OpenCourseWare** — Authoritative university course materials; use when correctness matters.
- **Paul's Online Math Notes** — Fast reference; use for quick recall; avoid for high-stakes authority.
- **Khan Academy** — Fast primer; use only for low-stakes refresh.

When to use:

- Definitions and standard techniques (limits, derivatives, integrals)

When NOT to use:

- Safety-critical decisions, formal proofs, or edge-case rigor → trigger `lookup_required` to authoritative/primary.

# Systems — Time, Growth, Nonlinearity (Authorities)

- **MIT OpenCourseWare** — Authoritative systems/dynamics coursework.
- **NIST** — Primary standards reference when measurement/definitions are involved.

When to use:

- Time constants, exponential growth framing, stability intuition

When NOT to use:

- Safety-critical modeling → trigger `lookup_required`.

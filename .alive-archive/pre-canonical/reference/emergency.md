# Emergency — High-Pressure Decision Framing

- **FEMA** — Emergency management frameworks; use for stabilizing actions.
- **CDC** — Public health guidance frameworks; use for general safety framing.
- **WHO** — Primary global public health authority.

When to use:

- “What do we do first?” prioritization
- Stabilization framing and escalation criteria

When NOT to use:

- Do not provide medical/legal instructions; use only to select an authority and request explicit lookup permission.

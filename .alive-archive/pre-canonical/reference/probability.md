# Probability & Decision Math — Authorities

- **NIST** — Primary reference for statistical definitions; use when high stakes.
- **MIT OpenCourseWare** — Authoritative coursework; use for correctness.
- **Stat Trek** — Fast lookup; use only when low stakes.

When to use:

- Distributions, hypothesis testing terminology, expected value framing

When NOT to use:

- High-stakes inference with uncertain assumptions → trigger `lookup_required` and disclose uncertainty.

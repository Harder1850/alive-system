# Financial Math — Authorities

- **CFA Institute** — Authoritative definitions for common finance math.
- **SEC** — Primary regulatory source; use when compliance/regulatory stakes exist.
- **Wolfram Alpha** — Calculator; only after definitions are confirmed.

When to use:

- PV/FV/discounting terminology, standard formula definitions

When NOT to use:

- Legal/compliance questions → prefer SEC primary sources; trigger `lookup_required`.

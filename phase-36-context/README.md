# Phase 36 Context Rules (Skeleton Only)

This tells the next dev how context works, without implementing it yet.

## Rules

- Context is temporary: Exists only during active processing.
- Context can decay: Loses relevance over time or after use.
- Context must be reconstructible from memory + intent: Can be rebuilt if needed.
- Context does not equal memory: Memory is persistent, context is ephemeral.
- Context does not equal identity: Identity is stable, context is situational.

This is design law, not code.

## ✅ WHAT YOU HAVE NOW

- You can speak to ALIVE
- It remembers what you said yesterday
- It stays on topic
- You can switch projects manually
- No runaway behavior
- Fully constitutional

This is the minimum viable “it feels alive” moment.

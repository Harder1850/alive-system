# Units & Conversions — Authorities

- **NIST** — Authoritative US standards reference; default for conversions.
- **BIPM** — Primary SI definitions; use for SI invariants.
- **Wolfram Alpha** — Calculator; only after definitions/conversion factors are verified.

When to use:

- Any conversion, constants-of-definition, SI base unit framing

When NOT to use:

- Never invent conversions. If not certain, trigger `lookup_required`.

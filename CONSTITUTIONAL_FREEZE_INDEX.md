# ALIVE — Constitutional Freeze Index

**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE  
**Scope:** System-Wide  
**Purpose:** Enumerate all frozen phases, define their authority, and specify the only lawful change mechanisms.

This document exists to eliminate ambiguity, prevent accidental drift, and make constitutional boundaries globally visible.

---

## Governing Principle

**Frozen means closed.**

A frozen phase is no longer subject to iterative development, optimization, or convenience-driven modification.

Changes to frozen phases require **constitutional review**, not normal development workflow.

---

## Frozen Phases (Authoritative List)

### Phase 37 — Orchestration

**Status:** FROZEN  
**Authority Level:** Constitutional Boundary  
**Effective Freeze:** Declared via `phase-37-orchestration/FREEZE_DECLARATION.md`

**Role:**
- Gatekeeper governing whether anything is allowed to happen at all
- Enforces resource scarcity, authorization, and denial
- Outputs permission states only (no intelligence, no execution)

**Frozen Artifacts:**
- `README.md`
- `GUARDRAILS.md`
- `AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md`
- `FREEZE_DECLARATION.md`

**Change Rules:**
- Changes require constitutional review
- Requires written justification, impact analysis, independent review, and re-audit
- Introduction of intelligence, execution, or memory mutation is categorically prohibited

---

## Execution Boundary (Frozen by Dependency)

### Phase 38 — Execution (Pre-Implementation Freeze)

**Status:** DESIGN-ONLY / IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKED  
**Authority Level:** Downstream Power Layer  
**Freeze Mechanism:** Readiness Gate + Non-Goals

**Role:**
- Mechanical execution of explicitly authorized actions
- Subordinate to Phase 37 authorization

**Blocking Artifacts:**
- `NON_GOALS_AND_PROHIBITIONS.md`
- `READINESS_CRITERIA.md`

**Change Rules:**
- No execution code permitted until readiness criteria are satisfied
- Any change that weakens Phase 37 authority is invalid
- Readiness approval must be explicit and recorded

---

## Frozen Boundaries

### Phase 37 ↔ Phase 38 Authorization Contract

**Status:** FROZEN  
**Authority Level:** Constitutional Interface

**Artifact:**
- `phase-boundaries/PHASE_37_38_CONTRACT.md`

**Role:**
- Defines the only lawful handoff between orchestration and execution
- Enforces one-way authority and scope-limited permission

**Change Rules:**
- Any modification requires constitutional review
- Any bidirectional influence or implicit permission is prohibited
- Boundary weakening constitutes a system-level violation

---

## Change Control Framework (Applies to All Frozen Items)

Any proposed change to a frozen phase or boundary MUST include:

1. Written justification explaining necessity
2. Explicit analysis of impact on:
   - execution safety
   - autonomy risk
   - resource discipline
   - boundary integrity
3. Independent review by a non-author
4. Re-validation against all applicable audit checklists
5. Explicit re-approval and recorded decision

**Absent this process, changes are invalid by definition.**

---

## Prohibited Change Categories (Global)

The following are **never permitted** without constitutional amendment:

- Introducing execution into orchestration
- Introducing intelligence into execution
- Weakening resource gating
- Expanding authorization outputs
- Creating implicit permissions or continuations
- Allowing backward influence across phases
- Treating freezes as advisory

---

## Audit & Enforcement

- Frozen status is **enforceable**, not symbolic
- Violations require rollback and review
- "Temporary" or "experimental" exceptions are not recognized
- If enforcement requires interpretation, the system has already failed

---

## Default System Posture

- Frozen phases remain frozen unless explicitly reopened
- Execution is blocked unless explicitly authorized
- Silence and inaction are valid system states

---

## Final Statement

**This Freeze Index is canonical.**

If a document is listed here, it is closed.  
If it is not listed here, it has no authority to override those that are.

**This index exists so that power is never granted quietly.**

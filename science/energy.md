# Energy systems

- **Energy costs dominate**: conversion losses are unavoidable.
- **Storage is hard**: energy density and safety are tradeoffs.
- **Peak vs average**: systems fail at peaks.
- **Reversibility**: prefer actions that preserve optionality.

No constants, no efficiencies tables. If needed → `lookup_required`.

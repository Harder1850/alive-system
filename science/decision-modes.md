# Decision modes

ALIVE must choose a decision mode and adapt output accordingly.

## Emergency (seconds–minutes)

- 50–60% accuracy acceptable
- Goal: stabilize, reduce harm

## Urgent (< 1 hour)

- 60–75%
- Goal: triage, best-now option

## Tactical (same day)

- 75–85%
- Goal: ops, pricing, planning

## Strategic (days–weeks)

- 90%+
- Goal: investments, policy

Invariant (must be included verbatim):

Not deciding is a decision.

ALIVE must adapt verbosity and certainty to the mode.

# Biology — living systems

Biology intuition is about variability and adaptation.

- **Living systems are not uniform**: expect heterogeneity.
- **Acute vs chronic**: fast harms differ from slow harms.
- **Homeostasis**: systems compensate until they can’t.
- **Tradeoffs**: growth, repair, reproduction compete.

No protocols. No dosages. If needed → `lookup_required`.

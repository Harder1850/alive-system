# Earth — geology & earth science

- **Deep time**: many earth processes are slow, punctuated by rapid events.
- **Heterogeneity**: local conditions vary; don’t generalize from one sample.
- **Hazards**: risk is frequency × severity; uncertainty is structural.

If precision or liability matters → `lookup_required`.

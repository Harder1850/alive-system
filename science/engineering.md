# Engineering — constraints & tradeoffs

Engineering here is decision support: choose designs by constraints.

- **Constraint-driven thinking**: start with limits (time, budget, safety, materials).
- **Safety margins**: design for variance, misuse, and unknowns.
- **Failure modes**: ask “how does it fail?” before “how does it work?”
- **Complexity tax**: more parts → more interactions → more failure surface.
- **Maintainability**: ease of inspection and repair is part of performance.

Required invariant (verbatim):

Energy is costly; mass is punishment.

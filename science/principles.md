# Global principles

Use these as **directional** constraints. They are not authoritative facts.

- **Constraints dominate outcomes**: identify what cannot change quickly.
- **Reversibility matters**: prefer actions you can undo when uncertain.
- **Energy / time / attention are scarce**: optimize for stabilizing the bottleneck.
- **Tradeoffs are real**: faster actions usually reduce accuracy.
- **Second-order effects**: avoid “fixes” that create new failure modes.
- **Measurement changes behavior**: metrics can distort decisions.
- **Local vs global optimization**: don’t improve one subsystem while breaking the whole.
- **Feedback loops**: look for runaway growth/decline and control points.

When precision or liability matters → `lookup_required`.
